This certificate program offered by Coursera is divided into seven parts and is designed to be completed in approximately six months. Many of the instructors are affiliated with Google or other companies related to marketing so it seemed like the information should be at least somewhat informative.

I did not know what to expect when I began this course as I have never done anything like this before. The first two parts began with a lot of introductions and encouragement and then the program switched gears to a broad overview of what online marketing is all about, this part was a bit more interesting as I had never really heard of a customers journey or marketing funnel or some these other terms before. The tests were easy and I believe they are really just there for you check yourself and make sure that you aren't losing focus.

The next course picked up and narrowed in on the areas of SEO, SEM, Google and things of that nature. It seemed like a good starting point for learning more but didn't get too deep into the specifics. 

I'm still only half way through this section so we shall find out how this all unfolds.
